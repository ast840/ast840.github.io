# Course Schedule

The class will follow this _tentative_ schedule. Updates will be posted here and on the course Slack channel! In the following **TB** refers to Thorne & Blandford, [Modern Classical Physics](http://catalog.lib.msu.edu/record=b12356242\~S39a), and **BS** refers to Baumgarte & Shapiro, [Numerical Relativity](http://catalog.lib.msu.edu/record=b12974302\~S39a). 
For course lecture videos and lecture notes, see [Lectures](lectures.md).
