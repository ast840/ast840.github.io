1. Read Chapter 1 in HKT. 
2. Describe in your own words the virial theorem and how it relates to stellar structure.
3. Define the dynamical time scale. How is it different from the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale? Under what conditions could the large scale structure of a star change on time scales significantly shorter than the dynamical time?
4. What is the mean molecular weight of a star comprised of 50% hydrogen and 50% helium, by mass, and no metals whatsoever?
5. What is the mass-radius relationship for stars on the main sequence? What is the mass-luminosity for stars on the main sequence?
