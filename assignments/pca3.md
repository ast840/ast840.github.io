1. Read sections 3.1 through 3.4 in HKT.
2. Estimate the value of the pressure scale height at the half-mass radius of the Sun assuming the Sun is a constant-density sphere. How does this compare the mean free path of a photon in the Sun?
3. Explain in your own words why the chemical potential for photons in zero.
4. How is the energy per particle related to the particle momentum for non-relativistic particles? For relativistic particles?
5. Assuming a gamma-law equation of state, quickly compute the gamma for a pure radiation gas. Comment on the implications of the value.
6. The average energy of a particle in an ideal Maxwell-Boltzmann gas is 3kT/2. Derive this value by multiplying equation (3.26) in HKT by particle energy and integrating from zero to infinity.
