# MESA Assignment 1

## AST 840: Stellar Astrophysics, Spring 2020, Michigan State

In this assignment, you will install and familiarize yourself with the basics of MESA. MESA will be used throughout the course, including for your final project, so it is critical that you get used to working with it as soon, and as thoroughly, as possible. 

1. Take a look at the [MESA homepage](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/index.html). In particular, read though the [Code capabilities](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/capabilities.html) section. The MESA homepage has loads of useful information about using the code. It will be an invaluable resource to you!
2. Install MESA on your laptop/personal machine. *Carefully* follow the [instructions for doing so on the MESA site](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/prereqs.html). I strongly encourage you to use the MESA SDK, as recommended in the instructions. Installing MESA from scratch can be...tricky.
3. Go through the [basic tutorial for using MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/starting.html). 
4. Finally, complete the [tutorial by Josiah Schwab given as part of the 2019 MESA summer school](https://jschwab.github.io/mesa-2019/).


### What to turn in

Nothing, really. Bring your laptops to class on Tuesday, 1/14, and we will verify that you have MESA working and have worked through the tutorials successfully.
