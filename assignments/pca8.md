1. Read sections 6.1 through 6.2.3 in HKT.
2. What are two possible exit channels for the capture of an alpha particle by a <sup>12</sup>C nucleus? For both decay channels, what is the excited state nucleus? Write out both reactions in compact reaction notation.
3. Without bothering with actual numbers, write down expressions for the probabilities of the two exit channels from above assuming that no other exit channels are possible.
4. For alpha capture on <sup>12</sup>C, compute the height of the Coulomb barrier in MeV. This reaction has an ignition temperature of about 6x10<sup>8</sup> K. Compute the typical alpha particle energy at this temperature. How does it compare to the Coulomb barrier? Comment on the significance of this comparison.
