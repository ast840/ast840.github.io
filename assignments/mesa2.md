# MESA Assignment 2

## AST 840: Stellar Astrophysics, Spring 2020, Michigan State

Complete the MESA exercise described at the end of Chapter 4 of the course [Notes](../assets/stellar-notes.pdf). To complete this, you will first need to download the MESA project directory available [here](../assets/0.3M-entropy.tar.gz).

### What to turn in

Plots of 1) stellar radius vs. central entropy; 2) central entropy vs. central temperature; 3) gravithermal specific heat vs. central entropy. For each plot, include comparison lines showing the expected analytic relations for each of these based on the results of the warm-up exercie.
