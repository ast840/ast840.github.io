### Problems

1. Exercise 2.2
2. Exercise 2.3
3. Exercise 2.5
4. Exercise 3.3
5. Exercise 4.1
6. In general relativity, pressure acts as a source of gravity as it is just another form of energy. Assuming the ideal gas law, estimate the temperature at which Newtonian gravity would break down and a general relativistic treatment would be required. As simple order-of-magnitude estimate will suffice.
