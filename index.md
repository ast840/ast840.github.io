# Syllabus

## Spring 2020, Michigan State University

### Prof. Sean Couch

This is a graduate-level course covering the essential physics governing the structure and evolution of stars. The course website is [ast840.github.io](https://ast840.github.io).

### Course Goals

This course emphasizes both stellar phenomenology and the physical processes that determine the evolution of stellar objects. The goal is a mastery of stellar "microphysics" and "macrophysics" at a chalkboard level, and the ability to integrate the disparate physical components into a physical model of stellar evolution. At the conclusion of this course, you should be able to 

- describe the evolution of stars and stellar-like objects from birth to death;
- explain stellar behavior in terms of simple physical models;
- perform simple back-of-the-envelope calculations of a wide variety of physical processes that occur in stars; and
- evaluate critically the output of numerical models.

### Communication and Mattermost

The primary vehicle for communication regarding this course will be the Physics and Astronomy [Mattermost](https://5fcw2e.stackhero-network.com).
There is a `ast840ss20` channel in the Mattermost workspace that you should verify you are a member of.
If you are not a member of the PA Mattermost, inform Prof. Couch and he will add you.
Discussion of course subject material and problems is encouraged.
You may also send direct messages via Mattermost to the instructor or any other member of the workspace.

### Text book and references

The primary text for the course will be ["Stellar Interiors"](http://catalog.lib.msu.edu/record=b2995045\~S39a) by Hansen, Kawaler, and Trimble. Readings and problems will be assigned from this text so obtain a copy as soon as possible. In addition, detailed course notes will be made available throughout the semester and we will draw on the sources listed in the references below. We will occasionally make use of material and reading from the online book ["Understanding Stellar Evolution"](http://iopscience.iop.org.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/book/978-0-7503-1278-3) by Lamers and Levesque. This book is freely-available through the MSU library online proxy.

### Use of HPCC

Some of the course assignments will utilize the MSU campus High Performance Computing Center (HPCC). All students must obtain an account on the HPCC. The best way to get an HPCC is through your research mentors. If this is not feasible, talk to the course instructor.

### Assignments

The coursework consists primarily of short pre-class assignments and longer homework problem sets. Solving problems is critical for mastering a subject, so these two components comprise a large fraction of the final grade. We will discuss materials and problems from pre-class assignments in class, so come prepared---you will be evaluated on your in-class participation. Presenting your solutions to the class is good practice for "thinking on your feet," an invaluable skill for a practicing scientist. Because we discuss the problems in class, it is important to have your assignment done on time. 

Pre-class assignments will be collected at the beginning of class and it is critical that you complete them prior to class time. Pre-class assignments turned in late will receive, at most, half-credit.

There will be a few longer homework sets that will be graded in detail. No rule of scholarly activity is more important than giving proper credit to the contributions of others. Although you are free to consult with classmates while working on assignments, you must explicitly acknowledge them by name and indicate their contributions and you must produce your own, original write-up to turn in.

The clarity and organization of your submitted work will impact your grade. Homework problem solutions should be clear and easy to follow. The problem should be briefly restated along with the general strategy taken for solving it. Prose and equation numbering should be used as necessary to increase clarity. When appropriate, final answers should be boxed. 

### Use of the MESA code

We will be using the open-source stellar evolution code [Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics](http://mesa.sourceforge.net) (MESA) in this course. During the first week of the course we'll ensure that everyone has access to a working installation of the code. The homework assignments will include problems that require the use of MESA.

You may find working with MESA at times confusing and frustrating. MESA is an actively-developed, _research-grade_ software instrument and is not always "user-friendly." This is, however, part of the intended learning experience. Whatever you do in astrophysics, you will at some point find yourself using, and perhaps relying heavily on, a piece of software written by another researcher who themselves was not a software engineer. And, indeed, may not have been thinking about any other users of the software but themselves... Learning how to make progress in such situations is critical. 

### Project

In the latter part of the course, you will complete a longer project in which you will explore a current problem in stellar astrophysics using MESA. You will decide on a topic in consultation with the instructor. You will be required to submit a two-page (including references) project proposal arguing the case for your project topic and citing relevant references. Finally, you will write, in a professional style, a report summarizing your work and findings. 

### Final exam

The final exam consists of a 30-minute oral examination in which each student will individually answer questions and work problems on a whiteboard. Appointments for the exam will be during finals week; You will be contacted during the last week of courses to schedule the exam.

### Grading policy

The weights for the course grade are as follows.

Category                   | %
-------------------------- | ---
Pre-class assignments      | 15%
Homework                   | 35%
Project (incl. proposal)   | 25%
In-class participation     | 5%
Final exam                 | 20%

The final course grade will be assigned based on the following scale.

Grade        | Overall %
------------ | ----------
4.0          | >=90
3.5          | >=83
3.0          | >=76
2.5          | >=68
2.0          | >=62
1.5          | >=55
1.0          | >=45

Your final grade will be no lower than that indicated on the above scale, though it _may_ be higher, depending on overall class performance.

### Outline of topics

The _tentative_ course schedule is available [here](schedule.md). Updates and details will also be made on that page and communicated via the course Mattermost channel.

### Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

Note that plagiarism of any kind, particularly in the final project report, will not be tolerated and will result in zero credit for any assignment that includes plagiarism.
